<h2>My academic story:</h2>
<p>I started my undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo with the intent to major in Actuarial Science and Finance with the goal of eventually working in the finance or insurance industry after graduation. However, after taking a few statistics courses in my second year, I was intrigued about the methodology behind the models used in my Actuarial Science classes, and decided to spend one of my co-op terms as a research assistant for Professor Peisong Han in the Department of Statistics. During this term, I facilitated his research on missing data analysis by implementing his methods – the application of empirical likelihood to the semiparametric approach for missing data analysis – in R and analyzing the results. I enjoyed the more focused and theory-based nature of my work, as I could explore the reasoning behind certain results instead of just using existing results and formulae in my work like I had done during my other co-op terms. Because of this, I realized that I wanted to stay in academia instead of working in industry. </p>
<p>As I took more statistics courses, I developed an interest in statistical modeling and computational statistics. I enjoy learning about statistical modeling because of the diversity of its practical applications, as well as continuous technological improvements which enable the use of increasingly complex and realistic statistical models. These factors provide ample opportunities for innovation as well as the refinement of existing methods to work with current and future technologies. I want to expand my knowledge to be able to keep up with and possibly even contribute to these advancements.
</p>
<p>Through being a TA in the math department every term since my second year of my undergraduate program, as well as volunteer work I’ve done outside of school, I know that I enjoy teaching. I hope to enter academia and eventually become a professor.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of my Master of Mathematics degree, I have focused on statistical computing and data science. I plan on writing my research paper on fitting models to financial data, which will combine my current courses with what I learned about finance during my undergraduate studies. Specifically, I will focus my research on fitting models based on copulas to financial data using quasi-Monte Carlo methods.</p>
<p>For my PhD, I want to continue studying data science and computational statistics. I want to be able to apply my knowledge to real-world problems and develop time- and resource-efficient improvements to modelling, especially financial modeling. The University of Toronto attracted me with its renowned research output. Despite having immensely enjoyed my time at the University of Waterloo, I believe it is important to examine statistics from a different viewpoint in order to ultimately broaden my knowledge and diversify my education. </p>
